title: Overview
description: "Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is a specialized process within machine learning that adapts pre-trained language models to perform specific tasks or to better understand particular domains."

Given the immense capabilities and versatility of LLMs like Llama3, fine-tuning allows these models to deliver more accurate, relevant, and context-aware outputs tailored to specific applications or industries.

## Data Preparation

Effective fine-tuning begins with high-quality data preparation. Follow these steps to prepare your dataset:
1. Collect Relevant Data:
  - Gather data that is pertinent to your specific task or domain.
  - Ensure data diversity to cover various aspects of the target application.
2. Clean and Preprocess Data:
  - Remove any irrelevant or noisy data.
  - Standardize to JSON format.
  - Handle missing values and correct inconsistencies.
3. Annotate Data (If Necessary):
  - Label data appropriately for supervised learning tasks.
  - Use consistent labeling standards to maintain data quality.
4. Split Data:
  - Divide your dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets to evaluate model performance effectively.
